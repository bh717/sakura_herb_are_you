## Installation

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Generate a new JWT authentication secret key

    php artisan jwt:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, articles, comments, tags, favorites and follows. This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Open the DummyDataSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeds/DummyDataSeeder.php

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh

# Testing API

Run the laravel development server

    php artisan serve

The api can now be accessed at

    http://localhost:8000/api

# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
 
This applications has CORS enabled by default on all API endpoints. The default configuration allows requests from `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:4200` to help speed up your frontend testing. The CORS allowed origins can be changed by setting them in the config file. Please check the following sources to learn more about CORS.
